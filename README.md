I've added a backup script to automate a major eve backup. Use at your own risk

## Moving to Linux

This started as an EVE Online specific store for information and learnings so I had a cental reference point. I now realise it can be more than that so Moving to Linux it becomes.

I play EVE Online... My charater is Wrdn and it is the primary use of my gaming machine.

Shameless Plug - [Use my recruitment link for 1M free skill points. ](https://www.eveonline.com/signup?invc=8521fd83-b94a-4433-9d34-76812f48b82d) Old and new players if you haven't used someone elses!

I also play other games, but with what I spend per month on EVE it always feels dirty playing other games.

## Great Communities

* Discord - [Eve on Linux](https://discord.gg/uYykxfw7ZH) a growing bunch of EVE enthusists working towards helping get people up and running on EVE
* Discord - [Linux Valhalla](https://discord.com/invite/DW2X8MHQuh) Home to Matts Creative. A community I've used extensively to get my feet under me with general Linux Stuff
